This a final project from NJITs IS 117 class in Spring 2022. This course was focused on Web Design, and the final project was making a site to host on Github pages.

The site for this should be up still at https://mjl62.github.io/P4/index.html

Looking back now, I don't hate the layout but the side margins of the page could be brought in, and the page elements could use better animations on hover. This page was not designed with a backend, and all of the information is hard coded as a functioning back-end was out of the scope of the course.
